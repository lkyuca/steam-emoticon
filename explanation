on steam you can add a link to a emoticon thats why you are here 
i am going to teach how to add a link to a emoticon 

here is an example how you write in text:  [url=https://example.com][emoticonname][/url]
and here is exactly how i wrote it in text:[url=https://github.com/lkyuca/steam-emoticon][:hacknetcog:][/url]

you can do this with invisible emoticon:
emoticon:https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/753/515040-%3ARareDeplorable%3A 
the problem with this is you need to buy the steam game and play 2 hours for it to work or buy the emoticon straight from the community market
game:https://store.steampowered.com/app/515040/Make_America_Great_Again_The_Trump_Presidency/

you can do this with cheaper games with almost invisble emoticons like:
emoticon:https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/753/534560-%3AYemot%3A 
game:https://store.steampowered.com/app/534560/Ramify/
