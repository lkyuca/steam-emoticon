Iâ€™ll show you how I did it.

**Write it like this:**       [url=https://example.com][emoticonname][/url]

**how i wrote it    :** [url=https://github.com/lkyuca/steam-emoticon][:hacknetcog:][/url]


you can do this with **invisible emoticon**:

if you buy the emoticon straight from the community market you won't have to buy the game 



if you want to buy the emote with **steampoints** you first need to buy the game and play **2 hours**

if you want to buy a emote with **steampoints** this game is cheaper however this emoticon is **almost invisible** but not completely:
