# Steam EMOTICON Guide

On Steam, you can add a link to an emoticon — 
that’s what this guide is about.  
I’ll show you how I did it.

---

### 🔗 Example Syntax

**Write it like this:**       [url=https://example.com][emoticonname][/url]

**how i wrote it    :** [url=https://github.com/lkyuca/steam-emoticon][:hacknetcog:][/url]


you can do this with **invisible emoticon**:

[completely invisible emoticon link](https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/753/515040-%3ARareDeplorable%3A )


if you buy the emoticon straight from the community market you won't have to buy the game 



if you want to buy the emote with **steampoints** you first need to buy the game and play **2 hours**


[game for the emoticon thats invisible](https://store.steampowered.com/app/515040/Make_America_Great_Again_The_Trump_Presidency/ )

if you want to buy a emote with **steampoints** this game is cheaper however this emoticon is **almost invisible** but not completely:


[emoticon:](https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/753/534560-%3AYemot%3A  )


[game:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/534560/Ramify/ )
