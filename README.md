### 🕵️ Invisible Emoticon Example

You can do this with an **invisible emoticon** as well:

🔗 Link to buy a completely invisible emoticon
</a>
</p>

If you buy the emoticon straight from the <strong>Community Market</strong>, you won’t have to buy the game.

### 💰 Buying with Steam Points

If you want to buy the emote with **Steam Points**, you first need to buy the game and play for **2 hours**.
