  <em>How to create hidden and clickable Steam emoticon link</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
On Steam, you can add a link to an emoticon — that’s what this guide is about.<br>
I’ll show you how I did it.

### 🔗 Edit Your Profile

**Write it like this:**

<p align="center">
<code>[url=https://example.com][emoticonname][/url]</code>
</p>

**How I wrote it:**

<code>[url=https://github.com/lkyuca/steam-emoticon][:hacknetcog:][/url]</code>

### 🕵️ Invisible Emoticon Example

You can do this with an **invisible emoticon** as well:

<p align="center">
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/753/515040-%3ARareDeplorable%3A">
🔗 Link to buy a completely invisible emoticon
</a>
</p>

<p align="center">
If you buy the emoticon straight from the <strong>Community Market</strong>, you won’t have to buy the game.
</p>

### 💰 Buying with Steam Points

If you want to buy the emote with **Steam Points**, you first need to buy the game and play for **2 hours**.

🎮 Game for the invisible emoticon
</a>
</p>

### ⚪ Almost Invisible Alternative

If you want to buy an emote with **Steam Points**, this game is cheaper.<br>
However, the emoticon is **almost invisible**, not completely.
