# steam-emoticon

on steam you can add a link to a emoticon thats why you are here 
i am going to teach how i did it 

here is an example how you write in text:  [url=https://example.com][emoticonname][/url]


and here is exactly how i wrote it in text:  [url=https://github.com/lkyuca/steam-emoticon][:hacknetcog:][/url]

you can do this with invisible emoticon:

if you buy the emoticon straight from the community market you won't have to buy the game 



if you want to buy the emote with steampoints you first need to buy the game and play 2 hours

if you want to buy a emote with steampoints this game is cheaper however this emoticon is almost invisible but not completely:
